            <p> The #nerdGang started as group of Full Stack Junior Developers attending the UC Berkeley Extension
                program.
                During the course of our studies we were tasked with creating a dynamic application that solved a
                problem. As
                lovers of food and drink we quickly settled on the idea of helping people make the most out of the
                ingredients
                at their disposal. Fridge.Raider was born ! A simple application for the low-key chef.</p>
            <br>
            <p> The concept is basic in its need yet complex in providing multiple options for an age old
                problem..."What to
                eat?". Input the ingredients you have access to and select the amount of recipes you would like
                returned. Then
                step up to the stove and discover whether you have what it takes to be a Fridge.Raider!
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The #nerdGang is made up 4 junior developers in training:
